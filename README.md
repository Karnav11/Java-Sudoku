# Java-Sudoku
The program would need to implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. Starting with an
empty cell, the program would try various numbers to fill it, checking each time to see whether it broke
any Sudoku rules. The algorithm would move back to the previous cell and try the following number if
a certain number didnâ€™t work. The method keeps going until the puzzle is finished or determined to be
unsolvable.
In order to display the Sudoku grid and enable user interaction with the puzzle, such as entering values,
the Java software would also need to provide a user interface. JavaFX and Swing can be used to construct
the interface
